//! `Genmesh`'s is a library that offers ways to generate and manipulate vertex streams.
//!
//! The core problem that this library solves is to find a nice way to build meshes that
//! does not just result in throwing all the vertices and indices into a `Vec<T>` and
//! calling it done. While doing so is simple from a library writers point of view, the
//! consumer will often have to translate that buffer to the format that they need before
//! it can be used. This produces needless buffering that can be avoided.
//!
//! `Genmesh`'s solution is to utilize the `Iterator` trait to build a vertex processing
//! pipeline. The `Iterator` trait has a number of useful functions like `zip`, `map` and
//! `collect` that are useful in themselves. `Genmesh` includes a number of traits that
//! can be used with the built in `Iterator` traits to build the meshes that your engine
//! needs.
